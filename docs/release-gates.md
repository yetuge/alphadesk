# AlphaDesk V4 — Release Gates

Release pipeline: `internal` → `beta` → `stable`. V4 ships the first **Beta**
candidate. Gates are enforced by `bun run release:check` (or CI step) before a
tag may be cut. A build that fails ANY gate is `NOT RELEASEABLE` and must be
labeled as an internal/unsigned build (spec §38–40).

## Hard release blockers (any present → not Beta-ready, spec §64)

1. Portfolio corruption / garbled data (parser expecting wrong CLI shape,
   unnormalized numerics, raw vendor output in UI)
2. Skills interactions broken (click → nothing, silent IPC failures)
3. Onboarding cannot complete (clean install, no repo, no .env)
4. Provider cannot reconnect after disconnect/expiry
5. Secrets in logs, bundles, or diagnostics exports
6. White screen (uncaught renderer error outside an error boundary)
7. Packaged resources missing (skills, pi extension, renderer assets)
8. Provider status inaccurate (claims connected while auth broken)
9. Critical action silently fails (no feedback, no error)
10. `bun test`, `bun run typecheck`, or packaged smoke red

## Test pyramid (spec §59–67)

Tests are organized in four levels; each level gates the next. Subagents,
the Lead, and the release pipeline each run exactly the levels their role
requires (see rules below). All levels must be green before a release tag.

### LEVEL 1 — Unit (per-package, in the working tree)

| What | Command |
|---|---|
| Unit/integration tests in one package | `bun test packages/<pkg>` |
| Typecheck one package | `bunx tsc --noEmit` (cwd = package) |

- Runs on every iteration while a package is being changed.
- **Subagent rule (spec §65):** a subagent runs ONLY `bun test packages/<pkg>`
  and `bunx tsc --noEmit` inside its own touched packages. NEVER repo-wide
  gates, NEVER launches Electron/AlphaDesk, no formatters/linters.
- Whole-repo variant: `bun run test:unit`.

### LEVEL 2 — Integration (repo-wide, in the working tree)

| What | Command |
|---|---|
| Repo-wide unit/integration | `bun run test:unit` |
| Repo-wide typecheck | `bun run typecheck` |
| UI component tests | `bun run test:ui` (`bun test packages/ui`) |

- `bun run test:integration` = test + typecheck in one command.
- **Lead/CI rule (spec §66):** the Lead runs LEVEL 2 + LEVEL 3 after merging;
  nothing below that is a release gate by itself.

### LEVEL 3 — Hidden Electron E2E (real app, window never shown)

| What | Command |
|---|---|
| Golden path A–H | `FINAGENT_AGENT_PROVIDER=local bun run test:e2e` |
| Interaction contract sweep | `cd apps/electron && bun run test:interactions` |
| Skills interactions | `cd apps/electron && bun run test:skills-interactions` |
| Packaged app smoke | `bun run test:package-smoke` |
| Fresh-install onboarding | `cd apps/electron && bun run test:fresh-install` |

- Every harness launches the real Electron app **hidden**: it sets
  `FINAGENT_E2E=1` and `FINAGENT_E2E_HIDDEN=1` in the spawn env.
- **Hidden mode is real, not simulated (spec §61):** `FINAGENT_E2E_HIDDEN=1`
  only sets `show: false` on the BrowserWindow (see `createWindow` in
  apps/electron/src/main/index.ts). The window is still created, the renderer
  loads and runs, and `--remote-debugging-port` keeps exposing it to CDP — the
  full DOM + IPC surface is exercisable while nothing appears on the desktop.
- Each harness self-cleans its own CDP port (pkill of its
  `remote-debugging-port=NNNN`) before spawning, so interrupted runs never
  leave zombie windows behind.

### LEVEL 4 — Visible / Release (manual debugging + release gates)

| What | Command |
|---|---|
| Visible E2E (manual debugging) | `bun run test:e2e:visible` |
| Release gate suite | `bun run test:release` → `bun run release:check` |

- `FINAGENT_E2E_VISIBLE=1` forces the window on for manual debugging only;
  it takes precedence over `FINAGENT_E2E_HIDDEN=1`. Automated runs must stay
  hidden.
- **Release rule (spec §67):** `release:check` → package →
  `test:package-smoke` + `test:fresh-install` against the packaged AlphaDesk.app
  before a tag may be cut.

### E2E flag contract

| Flag | Set by | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `FINAGENT_E2E=1` | every harness (spawn env) | Marks the process as an E2E harness run. Contract: main-process code MAY use it to distinguish test runs from real usage; today it carries no behavioral effect — hidden/visible is controlled by the two flags below. |
| `FINAGENT_E2E_HIDDEN=1` | every harness (spawn env) | BrowserWindow created with `show: false` — renderer + CDP fully functional, nothing on screen. Default for all automated harnesses. |
| `FINAGENT_E2E_VISIBLE=1` | manual debugging only | Forces the window visible even with `FINAGENT_E2E_HIDDEN=1` (visible = `VISIBLE==='1' || HIDDEN!=='1'`). Never set by automated runs. |
| `FINAGENT_E2E_KEEP_OPEN=1` | debugging only | Harness does NOT kill the app when it finishes; it prints `KEEP_OPEN` + the CDP port and leaves the app running so you can attach. **NEVER set in automated runs or CI** (see caveat). |

### KEEP_OPEN caveat (spec §63)

`FINAGENT_E2E_KEEP_OPEN=1` is a debugging escape hatch: the harness skips its
final kill, prints `KEEP_OPEN CDP port <port>` and exits, leaving the app
running (hidden window + CDP still up). Automated runs — CI, `release:check`,
`test:e2e`, `test:e2e:visible`, `test:package-smoke`, `test:fresh-install` —
must never set it: they rely on the harness killing the app and reusing its
CDP port on the next run. To clean up a kept-open instance:
`pkill -f 'remote-debugging-port=<port>'`.

## Quality gates (run repeatedly, never only at the end, spec §69)

| Gate | Command | Required |
|---|---|---|
| Unit/integration | `bun run test:unit` | 0 fail |
| Typecheck | `bun run typecheck` | clean |
| Build | `bun run build` | clean (renderer + preload + main + extension) |
| Electron E2E | `FINAGENT_AGENT_PROVIDER=local bun run test:e2e` | golden path A–H green |
| Packaged smoke | `bun run test:package-smoke` | green (from outside repo) |
| Fresh-install E2E | clean `userData`, no repo, onboarding → workbench → quote → portfolio → skills → research → thesis → alert → restart | green |
| Interaction audit | Playwright button-contract suite | every control: behavior OR disabled OR removed |
| Provider smoke | connect Longbridge → status accurate → quote/kline/news/portfolio via router | green |
| Secret scan | no keys/tokens in artifacts or bundle | clean |

## Beta release gate (spec §70 final acceptance)

Simulate a real new user — no git repo, no `.env`, no terminal:

1. Install Beta → Welcome → accept privacy/disclaimer (one-time)
2. Connect AI (provider + credential + model + test)
3. Connect Longbridge (in-app flow; no shell)
4. Connection test passes; capability matrix shows real coverage
5. Health check: AI ✓ Market Data ✓ Skills ✓ Agent Runtime ✓
6. Enter Today → open NVDA → quote/chart render with freshness info
7. Deep Research → evidence report → save thesis
8. Portfolio renders: numbers, names (unicode), currencies, PnL — no NaN/
   undefined/[object Object]
9. Skills: disable Technical → state changes immediately → re-enable →
   state changes immediately → open detail → all controls functional
10. Quit → relaunch: connections, portfolio, skills, sessions, research,
    thesis all preserved

## Release channel / versioning

- SemVer in root `package.json` + `apps/electron/package.json`
- Channel in `apps/electron/package.json` (`folia.channel`):
  `internal` | `beta` | `stable`
- About view shows version + build (git SHA) + channel
- Tags: `vX.Y.Z-beta.N` → GitHub Release asset (DMG + checksums)

## Signing policy

- No Apple credentials → unsigned `internal` build, labeled NOT RELEASEABLE
- `beta`/`stable` channels REQUIRE signing + notarization configured in CI
  (secrets-gated); the pipeline must not emit a "release" without them.
